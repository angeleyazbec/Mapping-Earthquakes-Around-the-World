# Visualizing USGS Earthquake Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Plotted a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 

Map includes the following information:

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. 
   
   * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Legends provides context for your map data.

   * There are different layer controls to view the eqarthquake data and tectonic plate data individually or together.
